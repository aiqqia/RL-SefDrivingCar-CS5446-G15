# RL Playground Setup

We need to first create and activate a Python virtual environment named `rl-playground` for running the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to your project directory
```
cd /path/to/your/project
```
### Step 2: Create the virtual environment
```
python -m venv rl-playground
```

### Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
#### On Windows:
```
rl-playground\Scripts\activate
```
#### On macOS/Linux:
```
source rl-playground/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Verify the virtual environment is active
#### macOS/Linux:
```
which python
```
#### Windows:
```
where python
```

### Step 5: Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
